This is a readme file for the report "Multimodal Biometric Identity Verication for Mobile Platforms" by VGIS group 18gr842
The zipfile contains scripts for iris segmentation, normalisation, feature extraction and categorisation used for a fusion net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
It is written in MATLAB 2017a and Pythin 3.6

Iris Segmentation and normalisation is done in MATLAB. To generate the files run miniproject.m .  It need as folder called "warsaw" with the Warsaw Iris database and another called "diagnostics" which it will put the iris images in. Move these to the folder "normalised iris" once it is finished running. miniproject.m will also generate database.m.

To do iris classification with machine learning (KNN, LDA and SVM) run iris_classification.py . It loads pythonDatabase to get the iris data. If pythonDatabase is missing it can be generated by running main_script.py

To do iris cnn recognition run iris_cnn.py . It loads pythonDatabase to get the iris data. If pythonDatabase is missing it can be generated by running main_script.py . It can be run with both the chimera data and the iris data before it has been merged. This can easily be configured by commenting out the chimera part and commenting in the old data. The nessecary parts to comment in and out are specified in iris_cnn.py .

To do face cnn recognition run VGG16_face_cnn.py . It will load the LFW database through Keras. As iris_cnn.py it is possible to do with the chimera data and with just the LFW data. The neccesary comments and uncomments are specified in VGG16_face_cnn.py .

To do the merged iris and face with the fusion net run merged_iris_face_fusion_net.py .

Dependencies:
imagePatchGenerator5_module.py : This takes an image and generates 5 patches. 
fusion_data_creater.py : This creates the chimera database used for the fusion net in merged_iris_face_fusion_net.py .
iris_face_merge_cnn_data_splitter: This takes the chimera data and splits it into train, validation and test set that can be used as cnn inputs.
load_database.m : Loads the Warsaw database into a matlab structure.
noiseremover_python.py: Removes the eyelashes from iris images and performs histogram equalisation.
noiseremover.m : Does the same noise remover part of noiseremover_python.py just in MATLAB
equalisehistogram: Does histogram equalisation part of noiseremover_python.py just in MATLAB
neweyelidsup.m : Does eyelid supression in MATLAB
cell2csv.m :  converts MATLAB cells to csv format. Used to create the label.csv file that contains the labels of the normalised iris images.

daugman folder: contains the library to perform daugmans integro differential operator in MATLAB. It is used to locate the iris bounds.
libormasek folder: contains the libormasek library that performs iris segmentation, eyelid supression and normalisation.
