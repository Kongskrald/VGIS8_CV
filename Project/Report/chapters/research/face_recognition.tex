\section{Face Recognition}
The first computer based face recognition was made in 1973. This was based on a feature approach, meaning the program identifies basic face features such as mouth, eye, and nose placement. 
From here three different types of approaches were made, namely a holistic and a hybrid approach. 

The holistic approach encodes the entirety of a face and then identifies using template-matching, whereas the hybrid method uses both template-matching and feature extraction \citep{Wechsler2007}.
In 1990, \gls{pca} was introduced for holistic face recognition. The \gls{pca} approach makes use of eigenfaces, each eigenface represents a component a face is encoded. But as \cite{Wechsler2007} claims, \gls{lda} is a more effective suitable approach for face identification and authentication. Another holistic approach is using \gls{svm} for face recognition \citep{Wechsler2007}.
