\newcommand{\projectAbstract}{
As computational power of mobile phones increases together with the capabilities of the built in camera new security measures are introduced to the consumer. These consist of both  iris and face recognition seperate. This project seeks to find a viable solution to combining the two functionnalities. By designing two networks, one for iris recognition and one for face recognition a fusion solution of the two networks are sought out. The iris recognition \gls{cnn} manages to reach a precision of $99.7\%$ and the face recognition $99.35\%$ individually. The fusion of the two networks...
