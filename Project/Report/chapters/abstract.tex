\newcommand{\projectAbstract}{
As computational power of mobile phones increases together with the capabilities of the built in camera new security measures are introduced to the consumer. These consist of biometric modalities such iris and face recognition separately. This project seeks to find a viable solution to combining the two modalities. By designing two networks, one for iris recognition and one for face recognition a fusion solution of the two networks are sought out. The iris recognition \gls{cnn} manages to reach a accuracy of $99.7\%$ and the face recognition $99.35\%$ individually. The fusion of the two networks reaches an accuracy of $81.17\%$. This is done on a syntethic made database merging the two databases, which also lowers the accuracies of the individual networks. Therefore, the..
