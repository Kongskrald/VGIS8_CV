\section{Equaliser}\label{sec:eq_test}
The equaliser is tested regarding \autoref{req:OR1}, \autoref{req:OR2} and \autoref{req:OR3}, to see whether the gain in the equaliser is sufficient, and if it is effective in the wanted frequency band. The full test journal is seen in \autoref{eq_meas_app}. Plots from the frequency response of the equaliser with the gain set to \SI{12}{\deci\bel} and attenuation set to \SI{-12}{\deci\bel} are shown in \autoref{fig:all_gain_test}. The band pass is also plotted at \SI{12}{\deci\bel} gain with two different center frequencies.

\end{figure}

It is seen from \autoref{fig:all_gain_test}, that it is possible to have a gain of \SI{12}{\deci\bel} and attenuation of \SI{-12}{\deci\bel} in the filter. It is also shown, that the band pass filter's center frequency can be changed. From the plot it is also seen, that the the equaliser can attenuate and amplify the signal throughout the entire audible frequency band. The equaliser can thus be concluded as successful.
