\section{Signal to Noise Ratio}
From \autoref{cha:signal_to_noise_ratio_measurements} the \gls{snr} through the \gls{dsp} is measured to 44 \si{\decibel} which is the value for \autoref{req:SNratio}. This means that the effects and the \gls{preamp} must exceed this value to fulfil the requirement. As seen in the results of \autoref{cha:signal_to_noise_ratio_measurements} the \gls{snr} in the \gls{preamp} and the effects are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Pass-through $\approx \SI{44}{\decibel}$	
	\item Echo $\approx \SI{45}{\deci\bel}$ 
	\item Reverb $\approx \SI{51}{\decibel}$
	\item Equaliser $\approx \SI{51}{\decibel}$
	\item \gls{preamp} $\approx \SI{58}{\decibel}$
\end{itemize}

This results in an \gls{snr} for everything that exceeds \autoref{req:SNratio} and thus the requirement is fulfilled. 

In \autoref{sec:preamp} the \gls{snr} for the \gls{preamp} is calculated to be 92 \si{\decibel}. The reason that the measurement is 34 \si{\decibel} lower is because of the Analog Discovery 2, that was used for the measurement, does not have the precision to measure such low values. It was apparent while testing, that the \gls{snr} of the \gls{preamp} was exactly the same, as the \gls{snr} of the wave generator, when the signal was sent straight through this. From that it is concluded, that the ratio for the \gls{preamp} is lower, than the measured 58 \si{\decibel}. New measurements using equipment with a higher precision are not done, since the measured value is fulfilling \autoref{req:SNratio}.
