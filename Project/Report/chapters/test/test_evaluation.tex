\section{Test Evaluation}\label{test_eval}
Through the tests of the implemented audio effects, it is concluded, that each of the effects fulfill their respective requirements regarding effect characteristics. Also the \gls{snr} of each of the effects and the \gls{preamp} satisfies the requirements.

Each of the delay based effects stay within the limits of delay that define the effects, and the characteristics of each effect are apparent when considering impulse response and spectrogram. 

The equaliser works within the predetermined frequency band, and it is possible to vary the gain within the wanted range. It is also possible to alter the center frequency and the bandwidth of the band pass, which makes it possible to amplify or attenuate any frequency inbetween the two shelving filters. The filters in the equaliser have the drawback, that they add some noise to the system that, when listened to, can be audible. 

Two of the main criterias for the tests to be viewed as successful is also, that each of the effects sound as expected, and that the plots of the impulse responses, frequency responses and the spectrogram are very simular to what was simulated in \autoref{ch:design}. Thus are the tests concluded as successful as a whole.

\paragraph{Requirement Evaluation}
The requirements are evaluated as a summary of the tests. The result of this is shown in \autoref{tab:allreqs}.
