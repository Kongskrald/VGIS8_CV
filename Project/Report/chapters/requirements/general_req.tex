\section{General Requirements}\label{sec:reqGR}
\reqPrefix{GR} %here we set the requirement prefix.
The requirements in this section are set for the general system. These also include the requirements for the interfaces between the different elements in the setup.

\begin{requirement}\label{req:buffer}
	\requirement{There must be an amplifier system between the guitar and the \gls{dsp} board.}
	\argument{In order to have an ideal ratio between the impedances of the guitar and the \gls{dsp} board and the amplitude between the guitar and the audio \gls{codec}, an amplifier also acting as a buffer circuit is needed between the two systems as stated in \autoref{ch:guitar_meas}.}
	\fullfilment{The amplifier is measured to have an output and input impedance, which has a ratio of at least 10 between the input and output impedance of the \gls{dsp} and the electric guitar respectively. Are these fulfilled, the requirement is met.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:input_signal}
	\requirement{There must be a variable gain circuit between the guitar and the \gls{dsp}.}
	\argument{In order to make sure that the input voltage of the signal is suitable for the \gls{dsp} to handle, it is necessary to be able to attenuate or amplify the input signal.}
	\fullfilment{The attenuating circuit is designed and calculated to be able to attenuate the input signal, and if no attenuation is wanted the gain must be one.}
\end{requirement}
