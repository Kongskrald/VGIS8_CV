\chapter{Requirements}\label{ch:req}
To be able to measure the quality of the project made, a set of requirements are presented. These are produced on the background of \autoref{cha:Research}.

The designed solutions must have an accuracy comparable to the ones of state of the art solutions presented in \autoref{cha:Research}. The accuracies presented are generally at $99\%$ or above, which means the solution must be equal or above this accuracy as well.

As the project seeks to make a better verification for security measures, the fused networks should perform better than that of the non-fused.
