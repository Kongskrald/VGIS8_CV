abstract = {The goal of the Multiple Biometrics Grand Challenge (MBGC) is to improve the performance of face and iris recognition technology from biometric samples acquired under unconstrained conditions. The MBGC is organized into three challenge problems. Each challenge problem re- laxes the acquisition constraints in different directions. In the Portal Challenge Problem, the goal is to recognize people from near-infrared (NIR) and high definition (HD) video as they walk through a portal. Iris recognition can be performed from the NIR video and face recognition from the HD video. The availability of NIR and HD modalities allows for the development of fusion algorithms. The Still Face Challenge Problem has two primary goals. The first is to improve recognition performance from frontal and off angle still face images taken under uncontrolled in- door and outdoor lighting. The second is to improve recognition perfor- mance on still frontal face images that have been resized and compressed, as is required for electronic passports. In the Video Challenge Problem, the goal is to recognize people from video in unconstrained environments. The video is unconstrained in pose, illumination, and camera angle. All three challenge problems include a large data set, experiment descrip- tions, ground truth, and scoring code.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art methods for 3D hand pose estimation from depth images require large amounts of annotated training data. We propose to model the statistical relationships of 3D hand poses and corresponding depth images using two deep generative models with a shared latent space. By design, our architecture allows for learning from unlabeled image data in a semi-supervised manner. Assuming a one-to-one mapping between a pose and a depth map, any given point in the shared latent space can be projected into both a hand pose and a corresponding depth map. Regressing the hand pose can then be done by learning a discriminator to estimate the posterior of the latent pose given some depth map. To improve generalization and to better exploit unlabeled depth maps, we jointly train a generator and a discriminator. At each iteration, the generator is updated with the back-propagated gradient from the discriminator to synthesize realistic depth maps of the articulated hand, while the discriminator benefits from an augmented training set of synthesized and unlabeled samples. The proposed discriminator network architecture is highly efficient and runs at 90 FPS on the CPU with accuracies comparable or better than state-of-art on 3 publicly available benchmarks.},

abstract = {—Authentication based on vein patterns is a very promising biometric technique. The most important step is the accurate extraction of the vein pattern from sometimes low quality input images. A single feature extraction technique may fail to correctly extract the vein pattern, entailing bad recognition performance. One of the solutions that can be used to improve recognition results is biometric fusion. A possible fusion strategy is feature level fusion, that is the fusion of several feature extractors' outputs. In our work, we exploited the feature level fusion to improve the quality of the extracted vein patterns and thus the feature extraction accuracy. An experimental study involving different feature extraction techniques (maximum curvature, repeated line tracking, wide line detector, ...) and different fusion techniques (majority voting, weighted average, STAPLE, ...) is conducted on the UTFVP finger-vein data set. The results show that feature level fusion is able to improve the recognition accuracy in terms of the EER over the single feature extraction techniques.},

abstract = {Our experience of the world is multimodal - we see objects, hear sounds, feel texture, smell odors, and taste flavors. Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.},

abstract = {Multimodal classification arises in many computer vi-sion tasks such as object classification and image retrieval. The idea is to utilize multiple sources (modalities) measur-ing the same instance to improve the overall performance compared to using a single source (modality). The varying characteristics exhibited by multiple modalities make it nec-essary to simultaneously learn the corresponding distance metrics. In this paper, we propose a multiple metrics learn-ing algorithm for multimodal data. Metric of each modal-ity is product of two matrices: one matrix is modality spe-cific, the other is enforced to be shared by all the modalities. The learned metrics can improve multimodal classification accuracy and experimental results on four datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing learning algorithms based on multiple metrics as well as other ap-proaches tested on these datasets. Specifically, we report 95.0{\%} object instance recognition accuracy, 89.2{\%} object category recognition accuracy on the multi-view RGB-D dataset and 52.3{\%} scene category recognition accuracy on SUN RGB-D dataset.},

This introduction complements other existing overviews of MCS, as here we also review the most prevalent theoretical framework for MCS and discuss theoretical developments related to MCS. The introduction to MCS is then followed by a review of the application of MCS to the particular field of multimodal biometric person authentication in the last 25 years, as a prototypical area in which MCS has resulted in important achievements. This review includes general descriptions of successful MCS methods and architectures in order to facilitate the export of them to other information fusion problems. Based on the theory and framework introduced here, in the companion paper we then develop in more technical detail recent trends and developments in MCS from multimodal biometrics that incorporate context information in an adaptive way. These new MCS architectures exploit input quality measures and pattern-specific particularities that move apart from general population statistics, resulting in robust multimodal biometric systems. Similarly as in the present paper, methods in the companion paper are introduced in a general way so they can be applied to other information fusion problems as well. Finally, also in the companion paper, we discuss open challenges in biometrics and the role of MCS to advance them.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Identification of individuals using biometric information has found great success in many security and law enforcement applications. Up until the present time, most research in the field has been focused on ideal conditions and most available databases are constructed in these ideal conditions. There has been a growing interest in the perfection of these technologies at a distance and in less than ideal conditions, i.e. low lighting, out-of-focus blur, off angles, etc. This paper presents a dataset consisting of face and iris videos obtained at distances of 5 to 25 feet and in conditions of varying quality. The purpose of this database is to set a standard for quality measurement in face and iris data and to provide a means for analyzing biométrie systems in less than ideal conditions. The structure of the dataset as well as a quantified metric for quality measurement based on a 25 subject subset of the dataset is presented.},

@article{Fierrez2018a,
abstract = {The present paper is Part 2 in this series of two papers. In Part 1 we provided an introduction to Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS) with a focus into the fundamentals: basic nomenclature, key elements, architecture, main methods, and prevalent theory and framework. Part 1 then overviewed the application of MCS to the particular field of multimodal biometric person authentication in the last 25 years, as a prototypical area in which MCS has resulted in important achievements. Here in Part 2 we present in more technical detail recent trends and developments in MCS coming from multimodal biometrics that incorporate context information in an adaptive way. These new MCS architectures exploit input quality measures and pattern-specific particularities that move apart from general population statistics, resulting in robust multimodal biometric systems. Similarly as in Part 1, methods here are described in a general way so they can be applied to other information fusion problems as well. Finally, we also discuss here open challenges in biometrics in which MCS can play a key role.},

@article{Cheng2017,
abstract = {This paper focuses on indoor semantic segmentation us-ing RGB-D data. Although the commonly used deconvolu-tion networks (DeconvNet) have achieved impressive results on this task, we find there is still room for improvements in two aspects. One is about the boundary segmentation. DeconvNet aggregates large context to predict the label of each pixel, inherently limiting the segmentation precision of object boundaries. The other is about RGB-D fusion. Re-cent state-of-the-art methods generally fuse RGB and depth networks with equal-weight score fusion, regardless of the varying contributions of the two modalities on delineating different categories in different scenes. To address the two problems, we first propose a locality-sensitive DeconvNet (LS-DeconvNet) to refine the boundary segmentation over each modality. LS-DeconvNet incorporates locally visual and geometric cues from the raw RGB-D data into each DeconvNet, which is able to learn to upsample the coarse convolutional maps with large context whilst recovering sharp object boundaries. Towards RGB-D fusion, we introduce a gated fusion layer to effectively combine the two LS-DeconvNets. This layer can learn to adjust the contributions of RGB and depth over each pixel for high-performance object recognition. Experiments on the large-scale SUN RGB-D dataset and the popular NYU-Depth v2 dataset show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for RGB-D indoor semantic segmentation.},

@article{Nam2016,
abstract = {We propose Dual Attention Networks (DANs) which jointly leverage visual and textual attention mechanisms to capture fine-grained interplay between vision and language. DANs attend to specific regions in images and words in text through multiple steps and gather essential information from both modalities. Based on this framework, we introduce two types of DANs for multimodal reasoning and matching, respectively. The reasoning model allows visual and textual attentions to steer each other during collaborative inference, which is useful for tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). In addition, the matching model exploits the two attention mechanisms to estimate the similarity between images and sentences by focusing on their shared semantics. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DANs in combining vision and language, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks for VQA and image-text matching.},

abstract = {Person re-identification (ReID) is an important task in video surveillance and has various applications. It is non-trivial due to complex background clutters, varying illu-mination conditions, and uncontrollable camera settings. Moreover, the person body misalignment caused by detec-tors or pose variations is sometimes too severe for feature matching across images. In this study, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), called Spindle Net, based on human body region guided multi-stage feature de-composition and tree-structured competitive feature fusion. It is the first time human body structure information is con-sidered in a CNN framework to facilitate feature learning. The proposed Spindle Net brings unique advantages: 1) it separately captures semantic features from different body regions thus the macro-and micro-body features can be well aligned across images, 2) the learned region features from different semantic regions are merged with a competitive scheme and discriminative features can be well preserved. State of the art performance can be achieved on multiple datasets by large margins. We further demonstrate the ro-bustness and effectiveness of the proposed Spindle Net on our proposed dataset SenseReID without fine-tuning.},

@article{Petrovska-Delacretaz2008a,
abstract = {Face recognition finds its place in a large number of applications. They occur in different contexts related to security, entertainment or Internet applications. Reliable face recognition is still a great challenge to computer vision and pattern recognition researchers, and new algorithms need to be evaluated on relevant databases. The publicly available IV2 database allows monomodal and multimodal experiments using face data. Known variabilities, that are critical for the performance of the biometric systems (such as pose, expression, illumination and quality) are present. The face and subface data that are acquired in this database are: 2D audio-video talking-face sequences, 2D stereoscopic data acquired with two pairs of synchronized cameras, 3D facial data acquired with a laser scanner, and iris images acquired with a portable infrared camera. The IV2 database is designed for monomodal and multimodal experiments. The quality of the acquired data is of great importance. Therefore as a first step, and in order to better evaluate the quality of the data, a first internal evaluation was conducted. Only a small amount of the total acquired data was used for this evaluation: 2D still images, 3D scans and iris images. First results show the interest of this database. In parallel to the research algorithms, open-source reference systems were also run for baseline comparisons.},
