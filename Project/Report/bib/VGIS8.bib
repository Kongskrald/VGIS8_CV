abstract = {We provide an introduction to Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS) including basic nomenclature and describing key elements: classifier dependencies, type of classifier outputs, aggregation procedures, architecture, and types of methods. This introduction complements other existing overviews of MCS, as here we also review the most prevalent theoretical framework for MCS and discuss theoretical developments related to MCS. The introduction to MCS is then followed by a review of the application of MCS to the particular field of multimodal biometric person authentication in the last 25 years, as a prototypical area in which MCS has resulted in important achievements. This review includes general descriptions of successful MCS methods and architectures in order to facilitate the export of them to other information fusion problems. Based on the theory and framework introduced here, in the companion paper we then develop in more technical detail recent trends and developments in MCS from multimodal biometrics that incorporate context information in an adaptive way. These new MCS architectures exploit input quality measures and pattern-specific particularities that move apart from general population statistics, resulting in robust multimodal biometric systems. Similarly as in the present paper, methods in the companion paper are introduced in a general way so they can be applied to other information fusion problems as well. Finally, also in the companion paper, we discuss open challenges in biometrics and the role of MCS to advance them.},

These characteristics may be physical or behavioral. The physiological characteristics as like finger print, iris scan, or face etc and behavior characteristics as like hand-writing, voice, key stroke etc. Face recognition is very useful in many areas such as military, airports, universities, ATM, and banks etc, used for the security purposes. There are many techniques or algorithms that are used features extraction in face recognition. This paper make a review of some of those methods which are used for the face recognition that are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN), Genetic Algorithm, and LDA, SVM, Independent Component Analysis(ICA). Each method has different -2 functions that are used for the face recognition. Dimensionality is reduced by using the Eigen face approach or PCA, LDA to extract the features from images. Genetic Algorithm is based on feature selection and Back propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is used for the classification of face images.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5{\%} and 17.0 {\%} which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2 {\%} achieved by the second-best entry. 1},

DANs attend to specific regions in images and words in text through multiple steps and gather essential information from both modalities. Based on this framework, we introduce two types of DANs for multimodal reasoning and matching, respectively. The reasoning model allows visual and textual attentions to steer each other during collaborative inference, which is useful for tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). In addition, the matching model exploits the two attention mechanisms to estimate the similarity between images and sentences by focusing on their shared semantics. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DANs in combining vision and language, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks for VQA and image-text matching.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. An error-correcting code (ECC) is a process of adding redundant data to a message, such that it can be recovered by a receiver even if a number of errors are introduced in transmission. Inspired by the principles of ECC, we introduce a method capable of detecting degraded features in biometric signatures by exploiting feature correlation. The main novelty is that, unlike existing biometric cryptosystems, the proposed method works directly on the biometric signature. Our approach performs a redundancy analysis of non-degraded data to build an undirected graphical model (Markov Random Field), whose energy minimization determines the sequence of degraded components of the biometric sample. Experiments carried out in different biometric traits ascertain the improvements attained when disregarding degraded features during the matching phase. Also, we stress that the proposed method is general enough to work in different classification methods, such as CNNs.},

@article{Hu2015,
abstract = {Deep learning, in particular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has achieved promising results in face recognition recently. However, it remains an open question: why CNNs work well and how to design a 'good' architecture. The existing works tend to focus on reporting CNN architectures that work well for face recognition rather than investigate the reason. In this work, we conduct an extensive evaluation of CNN-based face recognition systems (CNN-FRS) on a common ground to make our work easily reproducible. Specifically, we use public database LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) to train CNNs, unlike most existing CNNs trained on private databases. We propose three CNN architectures which are the first reported architectures trained using LFW data. This paper quantitatively compares the architectures of CNNs and evaluate the effect of different implementation choices. We identify several useful properties of CNN-FRS. For instance, the dimensionality of the learned features can be significantly reduced without adverse effect on face recognition accuracy. In addition, traditional metric learning method exploiting CNN-learned features is evaluated. Experiments show two crucial factors to good CNN-FRS performance are the fusion of multiple CNNs and metric learning. To make our work reproducible, source code and models will be made publicly available.},

abstract = {Multimodal classification arises in many computer vi-sion tasks such as object classification and image retrieval. The idea is to utilize multiple sources (modalities) measur-ing the same instance to improve the overall performance compared to using a single source (modality). The varying characteristics exhibited by multiple modalities make it nec-essary to simultaneously learn the corresponding distance metrics. In this paper, we propose a multiple metrics learn-ing algorithm for multimodal data. Metric of each modal-ity is product of two matrices: one matrix is modality spe-cific, the other is enforced to be shared by all the modalities. The learned metrics can improve multimodal classification accuracy and experimental results on four datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing learning algorithms based on multiple metrics as well as other ap-proaches tested on these datasets. Specifically, we report 95.0{\%} object instance recognition accuracy, 89.2{\%} object category recognition accuracy on the multi-view RGB-D dataset and 52.3{\%} scene category recognition accuracy on SUN RGB-D dataset.},

Reliable face recognition is still a great challenge to computer vision and pattern recognition researchers, and new algorithms need to be evaluated on relevant databases. The publicly available IV2 database allows monomodal and multimodal experiments using face data. Known variabilities, that are critical for the performance of the biometric systems (such as pose, expression, illumination and quality) are present. The face and subface data that are acquired in this database are: 2D audio-video talking-face sequences, 2D stereoscopic data acquired with two pairs of synchronized cameras, 3D facial data acquired with a laser scanner, and iris images acquired with a portable infrared camera. The IV2 database is designed for monomodal and multimodal experiments. The quality of the acquired data is of great importance. Therefore as a first step, and in order to better evaluate the quality of the data, a first internal evaluation was conducted. Only a small amount of the total acquired data was used for this evaluation: 2D still images, 3D scans and iris images. First results show the interest of this database.

abstract = {This chapter explains the iris recognition algorithms and presents results of 9.1 million comparisons among eye images from trials in Britain, the USA, Japan, and Korea. The key to iris recognition is the failure of a test of statistical independence, which involves so many degrees-of-freedom that this test is virtually guaranteed to be passed whenever the phase codes for two different eyes are compared, but to be uniquely failed when any eye's phase code is compared with another version of itself. The test of statistical independence is implemented by the simple Boolean Exclusive-OR operator (XOR) applied to the 2048 bit phase vectors that encode any two iris patterns, masked (AND'ed) by both of their corresponding mask bit vectors to prevent non iris artifacts from influencing iris comparisons. The XOR operator detects disagreement between any corresponding pair of bits, while the AND operator ensures that the compared bits are both deemed to have been uncorrupted by eyelashes, eyelids, specular reflections, or other noise. The norms of the resultant bit vector and of theAND'ed mask vectors are then measured in order to compute a fractional Hamming Distance as the measure of the dissimilarity between any two irises, whose two phase code bit vectors are denoted {\{}. codeA, codeB{\}} and whose mask bit vectors are denoted {\{}. maskA, maskB{\}}. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The recognition accuracy of a single biometric authentication system is often much reduced due to the environment, user mode and physiological defects. In this paper, we combine face and iris features for developing a multimode biometric approach, which is able to diminish the drawback of single biometric approach as well as to improve the performance of authentication system. We combine a face database ORL and iris database CASIA to construct a multimodal biometric experimental database with which we validate the proposed approach and evaluate the multimodal biometrics performance. The experimental results reveal the multimodal biometrics verification is much more reliable and precise than single biometric approach.},

This paper de-scribes IRINA, an algorithm for Iris Recognition that is ro-bust against INAccurately segmented samples, which makes it a good candidate to work in poor-quality data. The pro-cess is based in the concept of " corresponding " patch be-tween pairs of images, that is used to estimate the posterior probabilities that patches regard the same biological region, even in case of segmentation errors and non-linear texture deformations. Such information enables to infer a free-form deformation field (2D registration vectors) between images, whose first and second-order statistics provide effective bio-metric discriminating power. Extensive experiments were carried out in four datasets (CASIA-IrisV3-Lamp, CASIA-IrisV4-Lamp, CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand and WVU) and show that IRINA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in good quality data, but also handles effectively severe seg-mentation errors and large differences in pupillary dilation / constriction.},

abstract = {—Authentication based on vein patterns is a very promising biometric technique. The most important step is the accurate extraction of the vein pattern from sometimes low quality input images. A single feature extraction technique may fail to correctly extract the vein pattern, entailing bad recognition performance. One of the solutions that can be used to improve recognition results is biometric fusion. A possible fusion strategy is feature level fusion, that is the fusion of several feature extractors' outputs. In our work, we exploited the feature level fusion to improve the quality of the extracted vein patterns and thus the feature extraction accuracy. An experimental study involving different feature extraction techniques (maximum curvature, repeated line tracking, wide line detector, ...) and different fusion techniques (majority voting, weighted average, STAPLE, ...) is conducted on the UTFVP finger-vein data set. The results show that feature level fusion is able to improve the recognition accuracy in terms of the EER over the single feature extraction techniques.},

abstract = {Deep learning based approaches have been dominating the face recognition field due to the significant performance improvement they have provided on the challenging wild datasets. These approaches have been extensively tested on such unconstrained datasets, on the Labeled Faces in the Wild and YouTube Faces, to name a few. However, their capability to handle individual appearance variations caused by factors such as head pose, illumination, occlusion, and misalignment has not been thoroughly assessed till now. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study to evaluate the performance of deep learning based face representation under several conditions including the varying head pose angles, upper and lower face occlusion, changing illumination of different strengths, and misalignment due to erroneous facial feature localization. Two successful and publicly available deep learning models, namely VGG-Face and Lightened CNN have been utilized to extract face representations. The obtained results show that although deep learning provides a powerful representation for face recognition, it can still benefit from preprocessing, for example, for pose and illumination normalization in order to achieve better performance under various conditions. Particularly, if these variations are not included in the dataset used to train the deep learning model, the role of preprocessing becomes more crucial. Experimental results also show that deep learning based representation is robust to misalignment and can tolerate facial feature localization errors up to 10{\%} of the interocular distance.},

Several features were extracted by using sliding window mechanism for each modality and analyzed by using information gain, correlation, and symmetric uncertainty. Finally, five features from windows of continuous swipes, thirty features from windows of continuously typed letters, and nine features from corresponding phone movement patterns while swiping/typing were used to build the authentication system. We evaluated the performance of each modality and their fusion over a dataset of 28 users.

Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.},

abstract = {Iris recognition systems are a mature technology that is widely used throughout the world. In identification (as opposed to verification) mode, an iris to be recognized is typically matched against all N enrolled irises. This is the classic "1-to-N search". In order to improve the speed of large-scale identification, a modified "1-to-First" search has been used in some operational systems. A 1-to-First search terminates with the first below-threshold match that is found, whereas a 1-to-N search always finds the best match across all enrollments. We know of no previous studies that evaluate how the accuracy of 1-to-First search differs from that of 1-to-N search. Using a dataset of over 50,000 iris images from 2,800 different irises, we perform experiments to evaluate the relative accuracy of 1-to-First and 1-to-N search. We evaluate how the accuracy difference changes with larger numbers of enrolled irises, and with larger ranges of rotational difference allowed between iris images. We find that False Match error rate for 1-to-First is higher than for 1-to-N, and the the difference grows with larger number of enrolled irises and with larger range of rotation.},

This is called 1:N. They check the Hamming Distance between of the bits of the data and then choose the lowest ones as a pair. In 1:First search they do the same except there is is a threshold that that is has to be under to be accepted. If it is under that threshold it is accepted and the search is stopped. Two types of error can occour: a False Match (FM) and False Non-Match (FNM). A false match occurs when two samples from different individuals are declared by the system as a match. A false non-match is when two samples from the same individual fail to be considered as a match by the system},

abstract = {This paper focuses on indoor semantic segmentation us-ing RGB-D data. Although the commonly used deconvolu-tion networks (DeconvNet) have achieved impressive results on this task, we find there is still room for improvements in two aspects. One is about the boundary segmentation. DeconvNet aggregates large context to predict the label of each pixel, inherently limiting the segmentation precision of object boundaries. The other is about RGB-D fusion. Re-cent state-of-the-art methods generally fuse RGB and depth networks with equal-weight score fusion, regardless of the varying contributions of the two modalities on delineating different categories in different scenes. To address the two problems, we first propose a locality-sensitive DeconvNet (LS-DeconvNet) to refine the boundary segmentation over each modality. LS-DeconvNet incorporates locally visual and geometric cues from the raw RGB-D data into each DeconvNet, which is able to learn to upsample the coarse convolutional maps with large context whilst recovering sharp object boundaries. Towards RGB-D fusion, we introduce a gated fusion layer to effectively combine the two LS-DeconvNets. This layer can learn to adjust the contributions of RGB and depth over each pixel for high-performance object recognition. Experiments on the large-scale SUN RGB-D dataset and the popular NYU-Depth v2 dataset show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for RGB-D indoor semantic segmentation.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, con-sists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed reg-ularization method called " dropout " that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the sec-ond-best entry. 1. PROLOGUE Four years ago, a paper by Yann LeCun and his collaborators was rejected by the leading computer vision conference on the grounds that it used neural networks and therefore pro-vided no insight into how to design a vision system. At the time, most computer vision researchers believed that a vision system needed to be carefully hand-designed using a detailed understanding of the nature of the task. They assumed that the task of classifying objects in natural images would never be solved by simply presenting examples of images and the names of the objects they contained to a neural network that acquired all of its knowledge from this training data. What many in the vision research community failed to appreciate was that methods that require careful hand-engi-neering by a programmer who understands the domain do not scale as well as methods that replace the programmer with a powerful general-purpose learning procedure. With enough computation and enough data, learning beats pro-gramming for complicated tasks that require the integration of many different, noisy cues. Four years ago, while we were at the University of Toronto, our deep neural network called SuperVision almost halved the error rate for recognizing objects in natural images and triggered an overdue paradigm shift in computer vision. Figure 4 shows some examples of what SuperVision can do. SuperVision evolved from the multilayer neural networks that were widely investigated in the 1980s. These networks used multiple layers of feature detectors that were all learned from the training data. Neuroscientists and psychologists had hypothesized that a hierarchy of such feature detectors would provide a robust way to recognize objects but they had no idea how such a hierarchy could be learned. There was great excite-ment in the 1980s because several different research groups discovered that multiple layers of feature detectors could be trained efficiently using a relatively straight-forward algorithm called backpropagation},

abstract = {State-of-the-art methods for 3D hand pose estimation from depth images require large amounts of annotated training data. We propose to model the statistical relationships of 3D hand poses and corresponding depth images using two deep generative models with a shared latent space. By design, our architecture allows for learning from unlabeled image data in a semi-supervised manner. Assuming a one-to-one mapping between a pose and a depth map, any given point in the shared latent space can be projected into both a hand pose and a corresponding depth map. Regressing the hand pose can then be done by learning a discriminator to estimate the posterior of the latent pose given some depth map. To improve generalization and to better exploit unlabeled depth maps, we jointly train a generator and a discriminator. At each iteration, the generator is updated with the back-propagated gradient from the discriminator to synthesize realistic depth maps of the articulated hand, while the discriminator benefits from an augmented training set of synthesized and unlabeled samples. The proposed discriminator network architecture is highly efficient and runs at 90 FPS on the CPU with accuracies comparable or better than state-of-art on 3 publicly available benchmarks.},

Keynotes:

Not much work with deep learning has been done in iris recognition.

THey Use a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and talk about others who ahve used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). They also mention a Deep Belief Net (DBN) that others have used. DeepIrisNet is also mentioned and tested with

THey have created their own loss function optimized for iris recognition called Extended Triplet Loss (ETL)

Their network is generalizable to other databases meaning that it doesn't require finetuing as many others do.

Used ND-IRIS, CASIA Iris, IITD Iris and WVU Non-Ideal Iris databases to test on.},

@article{Zhao2017c,
abstract = {Person re-identification (ReID) is an important task in video surveillance and has various applications. It is non-trivial due to complex background clutters, varying illu-mination conditions, and uncontrollable camera settings. Moreover, the person body misalignment caused by detec-tors or pose variations is sometimes too severe for feature matching across images. In this study, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), called Spindle Net, based on human body region guided multi-stage feature de-composition and tree-structured competitive feature fusion. It is the first time human body structure information is con-sidered in a CNN framework to facilitate feature learning. The proposed Spindle Net brings unique advantages: 1) it separately captures semantic features from different body regions thus the macro-and micro-body features can be well aligned across images, 2) the learned region features from different semantic regions are merged with a competitive scheme and discriminative features can be well preserved. State of the art performance can be achieved on multiple datasets by large margins. We further demonstrate the ro-bustness and effectiveness of the proposed Spindle Net on our proposed dataset SenseReID without fine-tuning.},
