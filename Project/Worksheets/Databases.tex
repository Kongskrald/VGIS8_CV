Notes about databases

Several databases holding datasets of either face or iris are available: 

1) the UCI repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/
2) the KEEL repository http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/datasets.php
3) FKI repository http://www.iam.unibe.ch/fki/databases
4) Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com (not a repository by itself but it has plenty of large problems).

While there are several databases easily accessible on the internet with one of the two biometrics datasets holding combined information is less common. 

The Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge (MBGC) v1 and v2 data collections do hold such data but in a video format. They are free and available from

after signing the appropriate license agreements.
