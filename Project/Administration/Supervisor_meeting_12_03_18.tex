Problem formulering 
Vejleder rolle 
Bruge noget eksisterende? 




Show the use of iris as feature for identity 
and then evolve to include face. 


what system ? (old-school) old-school+NN or just NN

- stick with what is the most resourceful. solution with documentation. 
- Have to have both (but can be chimeric)

What preprocessing can be done in the cell phones
- Look into what is done with preprocessing of face 

Problem statement?
- Iris based recognition on cell phone using deep learning
- possibly exploring the inclusion of other traits 


Plan
- Search for multimodal database 
- implement Iris for cellphones (for the first time)
- implement fusion (how much does fusion with face improve this performe)


Network?
- Use the NN of someone else (Maybe even with their weights)
