\section{Na\"ive implementation}
The na\"ive implementation was first implemented. This was done using only standard python operations, however, Numpy arrays were used as well as the numpy.zeros and numpy.empty for creating the arrays. 

In the na\"ive version of the code a function is needed which creates histogram information based on an image and parameters given as arguments.


The final code of the na\"ive implementation can be seen in \autoref{AppNaive}
