This is the documentation for the VGIS 842 miniproject for Numerical Scientific Miniproject. A Python program was designed that does noise removal on normalised iris in polar coordinates and histogram equalisation. This was implemented first na\"ively and then optimised. Lastly it was also parallelised to improve performance speed.
