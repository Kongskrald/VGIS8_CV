\section{Test setup}
All tests were conducted on the same laptop in order to be as consistent as possible with the conditions under which the testing was conducted. The laptop used was a Macbook Pro from early 2013, running High Sierra. The Macbook has 8 GB ram and has a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor, which is a dual core processor. The scripts were run using the Python version 3.6.3.
