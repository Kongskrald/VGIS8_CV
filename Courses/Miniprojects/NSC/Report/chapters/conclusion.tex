\section{Conclusion}
It was possible to improve the performance time of he na\"ive implementation by more than 1300 times by using Numpy functionality. This greatly reduced computation time from more than 20 hours for the whole database to a couple of minutes. It was possible to optimise it further by parallelising the image processing. Using two CPU cores was twice as fast as doing everything sequentially. If more cores were available it could potentially be even faster.
