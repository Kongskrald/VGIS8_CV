\section{Conclusion}
It was possible to improve the performance time of the na\"ive implementation by more than a factor $ 1300 $ by using Numpy functionality. This greatly reduced computational time from more than 20 hours for the whole database to a couple of minutes. It was possible to optimise this further by parallelising the image processing. Using two CPU cores was twice as fast as doing everything sequentially. If more cores is available it can potentially be even faster.
