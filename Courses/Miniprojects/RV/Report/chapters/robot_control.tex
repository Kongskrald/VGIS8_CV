\section{Robot Control}
The robot was controlled by using a Matlab script that creates an interface to the UR robot. This is done with a TCP/IP connection. The robot is then controlled linearly or by joint values. Since the location of the brick is known, inverse kinematics can be used get the robot to that location.  As long as the location and orientation of where the end effector is supposed to be, the internal software of the robot takes care of the inverse kinematics.
